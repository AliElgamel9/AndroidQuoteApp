# AndroidQuoteApp

This repository contains a link to the "بليغ" daily quote Android application, which provides users with four quotes throughout the day at different times, including an Islamic prayer. The app can be customized to meet the user's preferences from the settings, and it features both day and night themes.

Additionally, the app uses a simple algorithm to determine the next quote based on how many times the user has clicked the love button on previous quotes and how many times those quotes have appeared before.

The app retrieves its quotes from a backend Firestore database, which is periodically updated with new quotes. The app checks the server every month to ensure that it has the most up-to-date collection of quotes.

Overall, the "بليغ" app is a great way to start your day with an inspirational quote, and its customizable features make it a unique and engaging experience for every user.

There is another application that is used as a backend for uploading new quotes to the server, although it has not been made available for public download. This application simplifies the process of writing and customizing quotes to ensure a visually pleasing result, making it easy to upload to the server.

Every quote within the application contains the quote text itself, one or more background images, text in a different color for each background, one or more font families, and tags. These attributes are utilized to ensure that each time the quote is selected, it has a unique appearance, with a distinct background and font family, ultimately resulting in an impressive user experience.
